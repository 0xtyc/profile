Hello! I'm Ting-Yu, a Full-Stack Engineer working in a swiss startup based in Zug. I have a Master's degree in computer science from ETH Zurich and a double Bachelor's in Information Management and Finance from National Taiwan University.

I enjoy building cool products and working with interesting people. My current experiences are primarily in web development, but I'm also exploring web3 and game development.

I'm convinced that physical strength leads to mental resilience, so I regularly do training to become stronger. When I'm not working out, I watch all kinds of anime. FYI, my favorite is _Attack on Titan_.
