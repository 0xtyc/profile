Hello! I'm Ting-Yu, a Full-Stack Engineer with almost three years of experience and a Master's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, as well as a double Bachelor's in Information Management and Finance from National Taiwan University.

I have a passion for building innovative products and collaborating with dynamic teams. While my primary expertise is in web development, I'm also exploring web3 and game development. I'm currently open to new job opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally.

I believe that physical strength leads to mental resilience, so I regularly train in martial arts. In my free time, I enjoy reading, baking, and watching animeâ€”my favorite is Attack on Titan.
